    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Canned sardines</em></strong
      >, particularly one in tomato sauce, are a vital part of Filipino diet
      when the budget is tight and one cannot afford to buy fresh fish or meat.
      Along with instant ramen noodles, canned sardines can feed an entire
      family or individual. They are inexpensive and convenient, that is why it
      has become one of the most preferred food supplies for college students
      back in my home country.
