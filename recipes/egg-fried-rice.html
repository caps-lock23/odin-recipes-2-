    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        First, cook any chicken flavored rice that you want according to the
        directions on the package.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the rice is cooking, whisk the whole egg and the egg yolk in a
        small bowl, and set it aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, coat a wok pan with peanut oil and put it over medium heat. Once
        it starts smoking, pour the excess oil out of the pan. Then add the
        garlic and shallot and fry them for 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the time is up, add the beaten egg to the wok and stir it around
        until it's almost solid. Then add the cooked rice and mix it with
        everything in the wok.
      </li>
      <li>
        After it's mixed, add the soy sauce and sesame oil and flatten it into
        the rice with the back of a spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, add the MSG, spring onion, and chili to the wok and cook for a
        minute or so, mixing all of the ingredients together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now that the rice is complete, serve it alone or with your favorite pair
        and enjoy!
